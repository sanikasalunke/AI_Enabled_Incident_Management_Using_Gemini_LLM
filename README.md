# 🚨 AI_Enabled_Incident_Management_Using_Gemini_LLM

This project demonstrates how to build a **complete AI-powered incident management system** using **Google Gemini** for real-time log analysis, classification, and intelligent escalation.

Gemini enables the system to **analyze server logs**, **detect anomalies**, **classify incidents by severity**, and **generate human-readable summaries** with **root-cause insights**. It also integrates automated **email alerts** and **escalation workflows**, providing faster and more reliable incident responses within IT operations.
