            "\n",
            "1.  **Initial State (05:40 - ~05:44):**\n",
            "    *   **Memory Utilization:** The system is using approximately **8.5-9 GB of \"used\" memory** (teal/blue) for active applications and the OS. There's also about **4-4.5 GB of \"cached\" memory** (orange), which the OS uses to store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval. \"Buffer\" memory (green) is negligible. The total physical memory being utilized is around **13-13.5 GB**.\n",
            "    *   **Swap Utilization:** During this period, swap usage (red line) is very low, around **9-10 MB**. This indicates that the system has ample physical RAM and doesn't need to offload data to the slower disk-based swap space.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Increased Memory Pressure (~05:44 - ~05:59):**\n",
            "    *   **Memory Utilization:** Around 05:44, there's a noticeable increase in **\"used\" memory**, rising to approximately **9.5-10 GB**. To accommodate this increased demand from applications, the system slightly reduces the **\"cached\" memory** to about 3.5-4 GB. The total physical memory being utilized remains high, close to **13.5-14 GB**, suggesting the system is near its physical RAM capacity.\n",
            "    *   **Swap Utilization:** Critically, as \"used\" memory increases, the **swap utilization (red line) begins to climb sharply**. It jumps from ~10 MB to over **19 MB** and remains elevated throughout this period. This is a clear indicator of **memory pressure**. The system is running out of physical RAM and is forced to move less frequently used memory pages from RAM to the hard disk (swap space) to free up physical memory for active processes. This can lead to reduced system performance as accessing data from swap is much slower than from RAM.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Sudden System Event (~05:59 - 06:00):**\n",
            "    *   **Memory Utilization:** Just before 06:00, there's a **dramatic and sudden drop in all memory utilization metrics** (\"used\" and \"cached\") to virtually **0 B**.\n",
            "    *   **Swap Utilization:** Simultaneously, **swap utilization also plummets to 0 B**.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The graph shows that the system experienced a period of increasing memory demand starting around 05:44. This led to significant memory pressure, evidenced by the spike in swap utilization, indicating that the system was relying on slower disk-based swap to manage its memory. The situation persisted for about 15 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The abrupt drop of all memory (used, cached, and swap) to zero bytes at the end of the graph, just before 06:00, strongly suggests that the **system either shut down or rebooted**. It's not typical for all memory to simply drop to zero without a major system event.\n"
